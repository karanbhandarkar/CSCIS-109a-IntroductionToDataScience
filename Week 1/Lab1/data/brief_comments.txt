Dogs have been with humans for millenia.  Although they do not speak human languages (e.g. English or Chinese), they have been watching and observing
us for all that time.  Their emotional intelligence is prodigious.  We are only just beginning to scrape the surface of the mind of dogs.  The nascent
field of dog cognition is beginning to shed light on ways to form meaningful communication with dogs.
